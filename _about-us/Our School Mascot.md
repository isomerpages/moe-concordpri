The eagles are exemplary role models to our <b>Care,</b><b>&nbsp;Responsibility,</b><b>&nbsp;Respect,</b><b>&nbsp;Integrity,&nbsp;</b><b>Loyalty</b> and <b>Resilience</b>. Like all our Concordians, the eagles possess leadership qualities and consistently work hard to uplift one another so that “<b>Together We Soar to Greater Heights</b>”.<br><br>
