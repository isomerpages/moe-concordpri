<p>Dear Parents / Guardians,</p>
<p>"Soaring Together: A New Year of Growth and Discovery"</p>
<p>A Happy New Year to all. I hope you had a fulfilling year-end break with
your family. My staff and I warmly welcome you and our students to a new
school year, especially our primary 1 parents and students as you begin
this exciting chapter of learning and growth.</p>
<p>As I assume the role of Principal at Concord Primary School, I am honored
to join this vibrant and nurturing school community. First and foremost,
I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to our former Principal,
Mr. Tan Siew Tiong, for his dedicated leadership and vision. Under his
guidance, the school has made significant progress, and I am committed
to continue building on the strong foundation he has established.</p>
<p>I would also like to express my gratitude to our dedicated staff. Their
tireless efforts, passion, and care have been instrumental in shaping the
positive and supportive environment that Concord Primary School is known
for. To our staff who have moved on to new chapters in their professional
journeys, we thank them for their valuable contributions and the impact
they have made on our school and students.</p>
<p>At Concord Primary School, we are deeply committed to our vision: Caring
Hearts, Enriched Minds, Determined Spirits and they are the foundation
of everything we do. They remind us that education is not just about academic
excellence, but about nurturing well-rounded individuals who are compassionate,
knowledgeable, and resilient.</p>
<p>Education is a shared journey, and parents are our invaluable partners.
Our Motto: "Together We Soar to Greater Heights" emphasizes the importance
of collaboration and community in achieving excellence. Your support, encouragement,
and involvement play a vital role in shaping your child’s experience at
school. As we work together to create a warm and supportive environment,
I am excited about the possibilities that this year holds for our students
and look forward to partnering with you in their educational journey.</p>
<p>Here’s to a meaningful and enriching year ahead!</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>Mrs Quek-Chua Leng Yin</p>
