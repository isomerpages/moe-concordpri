<p>Dear Parents / Guardians,</p>
<p>“Growing Together, Ready for Tomorrow”</p>
<p>As we start the year together, I would like to express my sincere appreciation
for your continued trust and support. Your involvement helps us nurture
Caring Hearts, Enriched Minds and Determined Spirits in every child.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank our dedicated staff for their care and commitment
to our students. Their daily efforts in teaching and pastoral care play
an important role in supporting our students’ learning and well-being.
To our staff who have moved on to new chapters in their professional journeys,
we thank them for their valuable contributions to the school. We also welcome
new staff who have joined our school and together, we continue to be anchored
in our strong culture of care</p>
<p>As part of the school’s ongoing efforts to strengthen holistic development
in our students, we have conducted a review of our Co-Curricular Activities
(CCA) programme, including our niche and modular CCAs. Guided by the perspectives
of our students and staff, the refreshed programme will offer a broader
range of opportunities across domains to support students’ interests and
development at different stages. More details on the CCA arrangements will
be shared with parents separately.</p>
<p>We have also reviewed the structure of our after-school programmes, adopting
a more targeted approach to better support diverse learning needs, student
well-being and holistic development. We will also continue to place strong
emphasis on strengthening teacher-student relationships and fostering positive
peer relationships, recognising that strong relationships are foundational
to students’ engagement, confidence and sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, the school embarked on a strategic planning
journey to chart our direction for the years ahead. This process focuses
on strengthening teaching and learning, student well-being, and partnerships
with parents and the wider community, so that our programmes remain relevant
and responsive to students’ needs, while nurturing students who care for
others, engage deeply in learning, and demonstrate resilience in the face
of challenges.</p>
<p>We look forward to working closely with you in partnership to support
our students’ learning and development. Together, we can continue to build
a school environment where every child is supported to grow with confidence
and purpose.</p>
<p>Here’s to a fulfilling and meaningful year ahead!</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>Mrs Quek-Chua Leng Yin</p>
<p>Principal</p>
