'As we step into 2022, we will remember and recall the numerous challenges that we experienced over the last two years. Our students have missed out on unique school experiences such as the Primary 5 Annual Camp, National Education (NE) Show, Learning Journeys, National School Games and the Singapore Youth Festival. With the enhanced Safe Management Measures (SMM), simple activities like group interactions during class discussions and at recess times have changed. With the new year, we look forward to return to some normalcy so as to allow our students to experience more social interaction and greater joy in their learning.

While it has been a very difficult time for all of us over the last two years, we want to take this opportunity to accord our praise and assurance to all our staff and students. They have challenged themselves to seek creative ways in doing things while being socially responsible to ensure everyone’s safety. We are indeed proud to say that Concord has done exceptionally well and has shown that we are a strong Concord family. While we applaud our staff and students for their courage and resilience in this challenging time, we would like to express our appreciation and gratefulness to our parents for pulling together with the school for showing care and support our students through the many weeks of Full Home-Based Learning (HBL). Well done, our beloved staff, students and parents!

As a Concord family, we continue to embrace our vision of nurturing every student to graduate with Caring Hearts, Enriched Minds and Determined Spirits. This will enable our students to achieve the school’s mission of nurturing Concordians with character and passion for learning to face life’s challenges. We strive to do our best to foster in our Concordians strong moral values to serve as a guiding light in their quest for knowledge and skills.

We have continuously explored ways to improve our teaching and learning, and our programmes and activities throughout the year to better meet the needs of our students. We have adapted ourselves quickly to the constant changes and our students have become adept at navigating their way around various online platforms and even recording themselves for their oral assessments. This year, we have enhanced the school’s learning environment to promote learning beyond the classroom. These include the National Education Learning Gallery, the hands-on Music and Art Corner, Boulder Wall, Outdoor Education (OE) Learning Gallery and the various garden spaces to conduct our Science trails.

We have introduced our school Mascots, **Connor and Caylee**, to strengthen our students’ sense of belonging and affiliation to the school. Our mascots encapsulate our school values and they are our symbol of strength and cohesion. We use them to anchor our Soar Redemption Programme which recognises our students for displaying and espousing of school values.     

As a school community, we will remain undaunted and we will forge forward to excel with care and grit. We are Concord - ‘Our Concord, Our Pride’, and together we will soar to greater heights.'
