<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>I trust you managed to spend some quality time with your children during
the recent June holidays, creating precious memories together.</p>
<p>As we move through Term 3, I would like to share some key highlights of
our school events.</p>
<p>I am delighted to report that our Primary 5 camp, held from 2nd to 4th
June, was a resounding success. Our students displayed remarkable resilience
and team spirit throughout the three-day programme. It was heartening to
witness their growth in independence, leadership, and camaraderie. I would
like to commend our teachers for their dedication in ensuring a meaningful
and safe experience for all students.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we will commemorate Racial Harmony Day on 21stJuly. Through
thoughtfully planned activities, our students will explore and celebrate
the rich tapestry of cultures that makes Singapore unique. These experiences
remind us not to take our social harmony for granted and reinforce the
importance of mutual respect in our daily lives.</p>
<p>Our National Day celebrations on 8th August will be especially meaningful
as Singapore marks its 60th year of independence. This milestone celebration
will feature special programmes that will deepen our students' appreciation
of Singapore's journey as a multiracial and multicultural nation. Through
these activities, they will learn how our unity and mutual understanding
across all communities have been fundamental to our nation's progress and
success.</p>
<p>This year, Concord Primary School celebrates a significant milestone -
our 25th anniversary. To mark this occasion, we have adopted the theme
“Giving, Growing and Glowing”, which reflects our school vision of Caring
Hearts, Enriched Minds and Determined Spirits. In honour of our school’s
legacy, we are celebrating this milestone by giving back to the community
through meaningful initiatives. One highlight is our Cranes for Good project,
a collaboration with SongHe Rice (Tong Seng Produce Pte Ltd) and Bukit
Panjang Government High School. For every paper crane folded by our students
and staff, SongHe Rice will donate rice to families in need - up to 2,500kg
for 25,000 cranes. We are heartened to share that 17,500 cranes have already
been folded.</p>
<p>With your continued support and partnership, we look forward to a fruitful
term ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours truly
<br>Mrs Quek-Chua Leng Yin
<br>Principal</p>
