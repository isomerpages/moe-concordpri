'As we step into 2022, we will remember and recall the numerous challenges that we experienced over the last two years. Our students have missed out on unique school experiences such as the Primary 5 Annual Camp, National Education (NE) Show, Learning Journeys, National School Games and the Singapore Youth Festival. With the enhanced Safe Management Measures (SMM), simple activities like group interactions during class discussions and at recess times have changed. With the new year, we look forward to return to some normalcy so as to allow our students to experience more social interaction and greater joy in their learning.

While it has been a very difficult time for all of us over the last two years, we want to take this opportunity to accord our praise and assurance to all our staff and students. They have challenged themselves to seek creative ways in doing things while being socially responsible to ensure everyone’s safety. We are indeed proud to say that Concord has done exceptionally well and has shown that we are a strong Concord family. While we applaud our staff and students for their courage and resilience in this challenging time, we would like to express our appreciation and gratefulness to our parents for pulling together with the school for showing care and support our students through the many weeks of Full Home-Based Learning (HBL). Well done, our beloved staff, students and parents!
