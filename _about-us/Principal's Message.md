<p>Dear Students, Staff and Parents,</p>
<p>Welcome back to school! I hope you have all had a restful break and are
ready for the exciting journey ahead.</p>
<p>As we embark on this new term, let us focus on growing together - celebrating
our successes, learning from our challenges and supporting one another
every step of the way. Our school thrives when we work as a community.
I look forward to seeing our students discover new interests, build friendships
and develop the skills they will carry with them throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of our school family. Wishing you a successful
and fulfilling year ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Mrs Quek-Chua Leng Yin</p>
<p>Principal</p>
<p></p>
