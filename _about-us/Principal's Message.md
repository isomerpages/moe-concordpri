<p>Dear Parents / Guardians,</p>
<p>I hope you and your family had an enjoyable term break, filled with moments
together with your children. Whether through family outings, shared meals,
or quiet moments at home, these experiences help strengthen family bonds
and create lasting memories.</p>
<p>As we begin a new term, we have planned engaging learning experiences
and activities that will both challenge and inspire your children. While
maintaining academic rigour, we aim to spark curiosity and joy in learning
through these activities.</p>
<p>We have planned upcoming parent engagement sessions, where we can share
more about your child's learning journey and strengthen our home-school
partnership. Your presence and participation in these sessions are invaluable
in supporting your child's educational experience.</p>
<p>Your support plays a vital role in your child's academic journey. Simple
actions like listening to their daily experiences, celebrating their efforts,
and maintaining consistent routines at home make a significant difference.
A conducive learning environment and adequate rest help them manage their
studies effectively. Through our partnership, we can nurture Concordians
who approach learning with confidence and resilience, embodying the values
of Caring Hearts, Enriched Minds and Determined Spirits.</p>
<p>We look forward to working closely with you and your child this term.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yours truly
<br>Mrs Quek-Chua Leng Yin
<br>Principal</p>
