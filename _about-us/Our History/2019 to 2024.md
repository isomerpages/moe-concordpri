<p>Under Mr Tan Siew Tiong's leadership, Concord Primary School has made
significant strides in enhancing its educational programmes, focusing on
deepening the impact of two core initiatives: the Applied Learning Programme
(ALP) in E3 Reasoning Programme and the Learn for Life Programme (LLP)
in Outdoor Education and SOAR for Life programme.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Deepening the E3 Reasoning Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Under his leadership, the E3 Reasoning Programme now follows a two-tiered
model. In the lower primary levels, students receive explicit teaching
in foundational reasoning, grounded in play and interaction. From Primary
3 onwards, E3 Reasoning+ challenges students with project-based and interdisciplinary
tasks, integrating higher-order thinking with authentic contexts.</p>
<p>Mr Tan’s educational belief is that learning must be developmentally appropriate,
cumulative, and deeply connected to real life. His leadership ensures that
this culture of inquiry extends beyond the classroom, into how teachers
plan, students collaborate, and ideas are shared across the school.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Learning Beyond Walls: Reimagining Outdoor Education</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Tan guided the team to rethink the programme not just as physical activity,
but as a holistic developmental journey.</p>
<p>At the heart of this enhancement is the OE Learning Hub, a space infused
with Augmented Reality, motion-sensor technology, and collaborative games.
This hub symbolises more than innovation; it reflects Mr Tan’s understanding
that today’s learners need immersive, socially engaging, and values-rich
experiences.</p>
<p>He also introduced meaningful physical challenges such as rock climbing,
bouldering, and eco-projects—to build resilience, teamwork, and environmental
consciousness. His leadership ensures the LLP cultivates not only fitness
and fun, but also character, courage, and connectedness.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Embedding Values Through the SOAR Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Through a tiered rewards system, students are encouraged to demonstrate
Concord’s values. This initiative, launched and refined under Mr Tan’s
leadership, reflects his deep belief in positive reinforcement and building
self-awareness.</p>
<p>Through his stewardship, Concord has become a place where thinking is
nurtured, experiences are rich, and values are lived.</p>
