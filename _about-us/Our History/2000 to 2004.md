<p style="text-align:justify">Concord Primary School is a school of the new millennium. It was built in 2000 to cater to the high demand for primary school-going children in Choa Chu Kang at that time. Unlike most new schools, it welcomed its first cohort of Concordians from Primary 1 to Primary 5 with a total population of almost 1500. The pupils came from several neighbourhood schools such as Choa Chu Kang Primary and Hong Kah Primary. Its unique name, Concord, refers to a state where people or things are in harmony and peace. The name was chosen as it offered a common home to this group of diverse pupils to forge new relationships and to learn and grow in harmony.

  

<p style="text-align:justify">Under the leadership of its <b>first Principal, Mr Chee Seng Liang</b>, the staff came together to envision its common goals and purpose. As a team, the Eagle was identified as the school’s mascot with traits of an eagle being highlighted as traits that Concordians should endeavour to develop.

  

<p style="text-align:justify">With such a big dream, Concord’s Motto “Together We Soar to Greater Heights” was born. The motto has since guided us well in our journey towards excellence. As a family, the staff came together to form the school’s Mission of nurturing “Creative, Independent and life-long learners” who were “Responsible and Upright Citizens”. Our first school song, co-penned by Vice Principal Mdm Ng Puey Koon, lifted the spirits of Concordians for years through its lyrics which depicted a strong sense of school identity and unity.

  

<p style="text-align:justify">Our inaugural Parent Support Group was officially established in August 2000 with Mrs Sum-Lee Mei Fong as its first Chairperson. It remains active now with its fourth Chairperson, Mr Cheong Yew Meng, leading his team of dedicated parents to make a difference in Concordians.

  

<p style="text-align:justify">On 30th June 2001, Concord was officially opened by Dr John Chen who was then Minister of State (Communications & Information Technology and National Development) as well as a Member of Parliament for Hong Kah GRC. It was also the year that saw our first batch of 173 Concordians excelled in PSLE with 98.8% promoted to Secondary schools.

  

<p style="text-align:justify">The first phase of Concord was marked with significant achievements which reflected its vibrant and conducive environment. These achievements included <b>Hibiscus Award for Green Audit 2001 and Gold Awards for Physical Fitness and its first WITs project on Teaching of English</b>.
