<b style="color:#0000FF">Together We Soar To Greater Heights</b>    
<b><em>Music and Lyrics by Loo Teng Kiat</em></b>

  
 
<b>(Verse 1)</b>   
Concord Primary is our school, we love her   
We work in harmony close together   
Respect and we care for all with our hearts   
You can count on us


We'll take on the world with love and flair   
Responsible words and thoughts we'll share    
Resounding in laughter everywhere


<b>(Chorus)</b>  
Staying true to this land we call home     
Our hearts will beat as one   
Staying true to our dreams, our hopes   
We'll strive for success; we will show you our best

  

<b>(Verse 2)</b>    
With caring hearts we will love each other   
Enrich our minds as we grow together    
No matter what colour cos' you are my friend    
And I'd call you my brother

Let's reach for the sky   
With our determined spirits high    
Together we soar to greater heights
