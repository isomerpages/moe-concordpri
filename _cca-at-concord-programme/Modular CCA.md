<h4><strong>Modular Co Curricular Activities (MCCA)</strong></h4>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1st tier consists of the Modular
Co-Curricular Activity (MCCA) which aims to reach out to and engage all
P3 to P6 students during curriculum time on Wednesdays between 7:30 am
and 9:00 am.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The programme seeks to expose students
to a wide variety of novel physical sports and outdoor activities for the
purpose of exposure, experience and appreciation of these activities. These
activities are provided for the enhancement of the students’ individual
skills and as well as to provide opportunities to inculcate team-work and
Character Building.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The students’ aesthetic appreciation
of the ARTs is also enhanced through dance, art and music -based activities.
Two other modules, Life Skills and Soar For Life are incorporated to prepare
the students for independence and self-reliance, as well as to enhance
their leadership capabilities and financial literacy.</p>
