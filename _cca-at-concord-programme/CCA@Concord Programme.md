<p>路&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Co-Curricular Activity Programme
at Concord (CCA@Concord Programme) aims to fulfil the Physical, Aesthetics
and Social-Emotional aspects of the students to provide a holistic experience
and growth. The objectives and outcomes of CCA@Concord are achieved through <strong>the 2- tiered approach</strong>.</p>
<p>路&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CCA model places a strong emphasis
on character development. Students are encouraged to internalize and demonstrate
core values in all CCA activities. Key values such as respect, responsibility,
and community engagement are highlighted.</p>
<p>路&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the model aims to
nurture self-directed learners by fostering a culture of reflection and
self-improvement, which is particularly evident in sports CCAs where qualities
like sportsmanship are emphasized.</p>
<p>路&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the model actively
promotes values such as empathy, leadership, and active citizenship through
various means, including engagement in community service activities and
VIA initiatives. This comprehensive approach ensures that character development
remains a central focus within the CCA framework.</p>
