<p><strong><u>WRITING</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students are taught various writing styles in class. The usage of questioning
techniques in writing is one of the key areas of focus for teachers during
writing lessons. Students are also exposed to planning their lessons using
graphic organisers. Students can reference mentor texts to improve on their
writing.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong><u>LISTENING &amp; SPEAKING</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students are exposed to a variety of listening texts, encouraged to speak
confidently by the EL teachers in the classroom. The school has embarked
on 2 main strategies for Oral Communication â€“ ACE for Reading Aloud &amp;
TREES for Stimulus-Based Conversation.
