International Friendship Day 2023

<p style="text-align:justify">Concord Primary School commemorated International Friendship Day on 3rd April 2023 this year. The theme for this year is Singapore in Asia. Asia is the world’s fastest-growing region, and Singapore continues to facilitate closer economic, political, social, and cultural cooperation within ASEAN and in Asia.</p> 

<p style="text-align:justify">On this day, our students learned about the different ASEAN countries through an interesting skit put up by our teachers during the Assembly Programme. Form Teacher Guided Period lesson packages on International Friendship Day were also carried out in class. Students were also exposed to varied recess activities which deepened students’ understanding of the different ASEAN countries.</p>
