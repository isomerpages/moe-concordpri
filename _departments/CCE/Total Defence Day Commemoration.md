<p style="text-align:justify">Total Defence Day, which falls on 15 February, holds great significance to Singapore as it was the day Singapore fell to the Japanese during World War 2 in 1942.

</p><p style="text-align:justify">As part of the school’s National Education efforts, Concord Primary School commemorated this day with several activities. During assembly, the students were presented with a drama skit produced by the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) department.

</p><p style="text-align:justify">The skit reinforced the importance of Total Defence and elaborated on the significance of the six pillars of defence for our nation.

</p><p style="text-align:justify">During the Form Teacher Guided Period sessions, students were guided by their teachers with customized lessons on the importance of a resilient food system and diversifying our food options.

</p><p style="text-align:justify">Subsequently, the students ended the day with a lockdown and fire drill. Students familiarized themselves with the school’s assembly area and the procedures to carry out during a school-wide emergency.
