Total Defence Day, which falls on 15 February, holds great significance to Singapore as it was the day Singapore fell to the Japanese during World War 2 in 1942.

As part of the school’s National Education efforts, Concord Primary School commemorated this day with several activities. During assembly, the students were presented with a drama skit produced by the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) department.

The skit reinforced the importance of Total Defence and elaborated on the significance of the six pillars of defence for our nation.

During the Form Teacher Guided Period sessions, students were guided by their teachers with customized lessons on the importance of a resilient food system and diversifying our food options.

Subsequently, the students ended the day with a lockdown and fire drill. Students familiarized themselves with the school’s assembly area and the procedures to carry out during a school-wide emergency.
