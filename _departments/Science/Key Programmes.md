    <td class="tg-aaqb">PASS programme<br><br>PASS (Providing A Support to Students to pass Science) programme aims to provide students with additional resources and support in preparation for Science PSLE. It was conducted for about 50 Primary Six students. During the 11 Zoom sessions, the teachers revised scientific concepts, process and answering skills learnt in each specific topic. Following that, the students applied these concepts on exam-based Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). By going through these MCQs, they were more exposed to various types of questions related to each topic. Students logged on to SLS after the Zoom session to retrieve the resources and could watch the recorded Zoom session again for revision.<span style="color:#0C463A;background-color:initial"> </span></td>
