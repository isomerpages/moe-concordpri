**COL.OURS** stands for **C**entre **O**f **L**earning - **O**ur **U**nique **R**esearches in **S**cience. It is to support Science learning for the Primary 1 and 2 students. Our students are exposed to exciting science videos, science activities in and out of the classroom so that they can explore different things around them as well as interesting non-fiction Science books to bring them into the world of wonder!

<img src="/images/Hydroponics.jpg" style="width:45%">		
	
Hydroponics is a soilless farming technology commonly used in Singapore. This hands-on programme provides a good opportunity for students to reinforce their learning on plants and plant parts. Students get to grow vegetables in our school’s hydroponics system, from transplanting seedlings to harvesting the adult plant after 3 weeks!

<img src="/images/High Achievers.jpg" style="width:55%">

It is a special programme that aims to nurture selected Science High Progress Concordians to be self-directed students with 21st Century skills such as Critical and Inventive thinking. We aim to inspire these students to learn beyond the MOE Primary Science Syllabus. This customised programme also provides opportunity for them to represent our school for Science competitions.

  
<center><span style="color:#0000FF; font-size:18px"><b>Primary 6  - PASS and ACE</b></span></center>
<img src="/images/Pass and Ace.png" style="width:45%">

PASS and ACE programmes aim to provide students with additional resources and support in preparation for Science PSLE. Science concepts, process skills and answering skills learnt from P3 to P6 are revised. ACE programme also extends the learning of our students. 

<span style="color:#0000FF; font-size:18px"><b>Primary 1 to 6 - ecopals@Concord (Environmental Education)</b></span>

<span style="color:#0000FF; font-size:18px"><b>Primary 3 to 5  - Creative Toy Making Workshop</b></span>
<img src="/images/Creative Toy Making Workshop.jpg" style="width:55%">

Selected students were invited to attend the toy making workshop conducted by the Science Department. They were given opportunities to make a toy, play with the toy, discover the Science behind the toy, make the toy better by reflecting on his/her learning and brainstorm ideas for the toy-making competition to enter the Sony Creative Science Award 2022.

<span style="color:#0000FF; font-size:18px"><b>Other Programmes</b></span>

<ul>
	<li><b>Parent Symposium</b></li>
</ul>
	
<img src="/images/Parent Symposium.png" style="width:65%">

Organised once yearly, the parents’ Science workshops are open to parents whose child is studying Science from Primary 3 to Primary 6. This event lets parents be familiar with the Science syllabus and some key concepts taught. We aim to equip parents with some strategies to support their child in the learning of Science at home. 

<ul>
	<li><b>Professional Learning Team (PLT)</b></li>
</ul>

<img src="/images/PLT.jpg" style="width:65%">

Every year, Professional Learning Teams of Science teachers will be formed and we will work collaboratively to develop NEW strategies or methodologies to improve the teaching and learning of selected science topics.
