<h2>Our Science Curriculum Framework</h2>

<p>Concordians are given opportunities to develop the ways of thinking and
doing science through various learning experiences. They engage in discussions,
hands-on activities and the use of SPAKLE kits bring Science to life in
the classroom.

<p>At COL.OURS, we believe that the spirit of scientific inquiry begins early.
Although there is no formal Science curriculum at the Primary 1 and 2 levels,
our young learners are immersed in rich and exciting experiences that ignite
their curiosity about the world around them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through engaging science videos, hand-on activities both inside and outside
the classroom, and a thoughtfully curated selection of non-fiction Science
books, students are encouraged to explore, ask questions, and discover.</p>
<p></p>
<p>COL.OURS@ Primary 1&amp;2 lays a strong foundation for a lifelong love
of Science by nurturing inquisitive minds and a sense of wonder in every
child.

<p>Primary 3 students are given an opportunity to experience urban farming
first-hand in our school’s garden during their Modular CCA. Besides reinforcing
their Science learning on plants, it inculcates outdoor education life
skills, shelter building, dengue prevention as well as the values of responsibility,
teamwork and care towards plants and our environment.</p>

<p>Hydroponics is a soilless farming technology commonly used in Singapore.
This hands-on programme provides a good opportunity for students to reinforce
their learning on plants and plant parts. Primary 4 students get to grow
vegetables in our school’s hydroponics system, from transplanting seedlings
to harvesting the adult plant after three to four weeks!
