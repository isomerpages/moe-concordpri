</p><p style="text-align:justify">Through engaging and experiential activities, students learn to communicate effectively, manage conflicts constructively, and apply these skills in real-life situations. By the end of the programme, our students will be more confident and competent, ready to lead at the self, peer, and community levels, and to contribute positively to the school and beyond.
