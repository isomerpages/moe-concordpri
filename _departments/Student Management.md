<p></p><h4>Soar for Life Programme for Primary 3 to Primary 6</h4>

<p style="text-align:justify">At Concord, we believe in nurturing students to become confident, responsible, and effective leaders. Our Soar for Life Programme is designed to equip students with age-appropriate skillsets such as critical thinking, a growth mindset, and key leadership competencies.
</p><p style="text-align:justify">Through engaging and experiential activities, students learn to communicate effectively, manage conflicts constructively, and apply these skills in real-life situations. By the end of the programme, our students will be more confident and competent, ready to lead at the self, peer, and community levels, and to contribute positively to the school and beyond.
