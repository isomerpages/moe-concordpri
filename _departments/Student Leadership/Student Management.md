<h2>Key Programmes and Activities</h2>
<p></p>
<h4>Soar for Life Programme for Primary 3 to Primary 6</h4>
<p>At Concord, we believe in nurturing students to become confident, responsible,
and effective leaders. Our Soar for Life Programme is designed to equip
students with age-appropriate skillsets such as critical thinking, a growth
mindset, and key leadership competencies.</p>
<p>Through engaging and experiential activities, students learn to communicate
effectively, manage conflicts constructively, and apply these skills in
real-life situations. By the end of the programme, our students will be
more confident and competent, ready to lead at the self, peer, and community
levels, and to contribute positively to the school and beyond.</p>

<h4>Pre-Assembly and Assembly Programme</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Our Pre-Asembly and Assembly Programme plays a key role in shaping a positive
school culture and nurturing the holistic development of our students.
Held weekly on Mondays and Fridays, these sessions, go beyond school announcements,
they are designed to :</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote Chracter and Leadership Development</p>
<p>Through talks and sharing by school leaders, teachers, student leaders
and community partners, we provide platform for students to reflect on
our school values, build character, and grow as useful citizen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Celebrate Achievements</p>
<p>We take time to recognise students' efforts and successes, whether in
academics, character, Leadership, or co-curricular activities - fostering
a culture of encouragement and motivation.</p>
<p>Other than silent reading, our pre assembly time is also used meaningfully
to engage students with motivational quotes and key messages on school
values. Through this programme, we aim to nurture confident and well-rounded
Concordians who uphold school values and contribute positively to our community.

<h4>Termly Affirmation Programme</h4>
<p>The termly Affirmation Programme recognises students who demonstrate good
character, positive behaviour, and leadership qualities. It is designed
to acknowledge those who consistently uphold our school values and serve
as positive role models to their peers.</p>
<p>Each term, teachers nominate students who have shown outstanding efforts
in displaying school values or taking on leadership roles in class, across
their level, or within the school. Nominated students will be presented
with the Termly Affirmation Certificate during the first week of Term 2
and 3, and at the end of Term 4.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Monthly Moments of Joy - Birthday Celebrations</h4>
<p>Each month, we hold simple in-class and level birthday celebrations to
create joyful memories with our student together.</p>
<p>These celebrations help strengthen bonds within the class and across the
level, while reminding every child that they are remembered and cherished.
While we do not give out birthday gifts as we focus on nurturing intrinsic
motivation, teachers mark the occasion with warm wishes, birthday songs,
and photos to capture the special moments.</p>
<p>Through these small but meaningful celebrations, we aim to create a warm
and caring environment where every child feels supported and celebrated.
