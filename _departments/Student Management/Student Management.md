Vision:

Positive Role Models, Embodiment of Values and Culture

Mission:
--------

To provide a positive and safe environment for Concordians to grow and learn.

Department's Framework: 
------------------------

To enhance every Concordian’s educational journey, the department oversees aspects of Student Discipline, Leadership, and Safety through a multitude of structured platforms.  

Every student is an embodiment of the school values and iGIVE culture. We aim to provide Concordians with a positive and firm environment where discipline and self-management guide their actions.

Every student is a leader at the school. We aim to equip Concordians with leadership traits and competencies by effectively implementing explicit teaching while staging opportunities for students to execute their knowledge. The tiered student leadership structure guides us in deciding frequency and depth of leadership exposure.

Every student is provided with a safe environment to explore their interests and passions. We aim to provide Concordians with a safe physical and emotional environment that nurtures them on their journey of growth. The school strongly advocates a whole-school student management approach. We aim to provide a caring yet firm culture that supports the well-being of our Concordians, encouraging the growth and development of the unique personalities of our students.

Steps are taken to ensure that the school community is a safe and healthy place for all children. A caring culture that supports the well-being of students will encourage growth and development of unique personalities in all possible ways. Every student will receive adequate and well-timed support to her/his learning and growth. Special support and individual help is provided to mitigate students’ physical, psychological or social problems to help stretch our students to **soar to greater heights**.
