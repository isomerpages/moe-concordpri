<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Positive Role Models, Embodiment of Values and Culture</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To provide a positive and safe environment for Concordians to grow and
learn.</p>
<p>The Student Management Department enriches every Concordian’s educational
journey by creating a caring, safe and enabling school environment where
students are empowered to develop self-discipline, responsibility, and
well-being.</p>
<h4><strong>Discipline </strong></h4>
<p>We nurture a positive yet firm environment where students uphold the school’s
core values and practise self-management. Guided by our iGIVE culture,
discipline is approached as a developmental process that builds responsibility
and reflection, while providing opportunities for students to exercise
voice and agency in making informed and positive choices.</p>
<h4><strong>Safety &amp; Well-being </strong></h4>
<p>We foster a safe, caring and enabling environment where students feel
heard, respected, and supported. Through a whole school tiered approach,
students are given appropriate platforms to express their needs, receive
timely support, and build confidence. This ensures that every Concordian
receives the care and guidance needed to thrive and soar to greater heights.</p>
<h4><strong>Department’s highlights/framework:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>SOAR in Action</strong> is Concord Primary School’s approach to
strengthening student character, habits and identity through consistent
daily practices. Building on our learning from past approaches, the school
has intentionally moved away from the former SOAR Redemption Programme
towards a more proactive, strengths-based model that emphasises early guidance
rather than corrective follow-up.</p>
<p>The focus is on making the school’s core values visible by translating
them into clear, observable student behaviours, supported through routines,
modelling and affirmation. Through weekly social stories,</p>
<p>explicit demonstrations of expected behaviours, and timely teacher affirmations,
students are guided to practise positive actions. Teachers use shared language
to notice and affirm behaviours aligned with Concord’s core values. SOAR
in Action adopts a light-touch, class-based approach that focuses on habit-building,
reflection and identity development. By embedding these practices into
daily classroom routines, the approach strengthens classroom climate, student
engagement and relationships, and supports Concordians in becoming responsible,
caring and reflective individuals.</p>

<h4><strong>Back to School Programme </strong></h4>
<p>The Back-to-School Programme plays a vital role in helping students transition
smoothly into the new school year by establishing a safe, caring and enabling
environment from the very first day of school. Designed as a whole school
effort, the programme supports students’ emotional readiness, strengthens
relationships, and reinforces positive routines and expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting Student Well-being and Belonging </strong>
</p>
<p>The programme focuses on helping students feel welcomed, safe, and connected
to the school community. Through structured activities and intentional
interactions with teachers and peers, students are supported in settling
into school routines while building a sense of belonging and trust.</p>

<p><strong><br>Whole School Collaboration and Partnerships </strong>
</p>
<p>The programme is implemented in close collaboration with Instructional
Programme (IP) departments, Year Heads, Form Teachers, and support staff
to ensure consistency in messages and practices across levels. Where appropriate,
external partners are engaged to provide additional support and resources
that enhance students’ socio-emotional well-being and readiness for learning.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Student Voice and Agency</strong>
</p>
<p>Opportunities are built into the programme for students to share their
thoughts, experiences, and expectations for the new school year. Through
guided reflections and interactive activities, students are encouraged
to exercise voice and agency, take ownership of their behaviour, and set
personal goals aligned with school values.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Reinforcing Values, Expectations and Routines</strong>
</p>
<p>Key school values, behavioural expectations, and safety routines are explicitly
taught and modelled during the programme. This helps students understand
the purpose behind school rules and supports the development of self-management
and responsible decision-making.</p>
<p>Through the Back-to-School Programme, we aim to establish strong foundations
for learning by nurturing confident, well-supported and reflective Concordians
who are ready to engage positively with their learning and the school community.</p>

<p>Our Pre-Asembly and Assembly Programme plays a key role in shaping a positive
school culture and nurturing the holistic development of our students.
Held weekly on Mondays and Fridays, these sessions, go beyond school announcements,
they are designed to :</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote Chracter and Leadership Development</p>
<p>Through talks and sharing by school leaders, teachers, student leaders
and community partners, we provide platform for students to reflect on
our school values, build character, and grow as useful citizen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Celebrate Achievements</p>
<p>We take time to recognise students' efforts and successes, whether in
academics, character, Leadership, or co-curricular activities - fostering
a culture of encouragement and motivation.</p>
<p>Other than silent reading, our pre assembly time is also used meaningfully
to engage students with motivational quotes and key messages on school
values. Through this programme, we aim to nurture confident and well-rounded
Concordians who uphold school values and contribute positively to our community.

<h4>Termly Affirmation Programme</h4>
<p>The termly Affirmation Programme recognises students who demonstrate good
character, positive behaviour, and leadership qualities. It is designed
to acknowledge those who consistently uphold our school values and serve
as positive role models to their peers.</p>
<p>Each term, teachers nominate students who have shown outstanding efforts
in displaying school values or taking on leadership roles in class, across
their level, or within the school. Nominated students will be presented
with the Termly Affirmation Certificate during the first week of Term 2
and 3, and at the end of Term 4.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Monthly Moments of Joy - Birthday Celebrations</h4>
<p>Each month, we hold simple in-class and level birthday celebrations to
create joyful memories with our student together.</p>
<p>These celebrations help strengthen bonds within the class and across the
level, while reminding every child that they are remembered and cherished.
While we do not give out birthday gifts as we focus on nurturing intrinsic
motivation, teachers mark the occasion with warm wishes, birthday songs,
and photos to capture the special moments.</p>
<p>Through these small but meaningful celebrations, we aim to create a warm
and caring environment where every child feels supported and celebrated.
