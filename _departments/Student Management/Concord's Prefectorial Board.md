    <td class="tg-n1ni">I believe that as a leader, we need to take the initiative to help anyone in need and listen to others. A good leader is also a good team player. And most importantly a good leader should be a role model and influence others positively. One quote that I hold close to my heart is "Leaders lead from the heart, not the head." This quote is a reminder for me that in order to be a good leader, I have to touch people's heart in order to take their hands and lead them. I strive to be a leader who can lead with a heart, touch the hearts of others with love and care. Hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, I hope to walk with all concordians towards our school motto: Together, we soar to greater heights, where everyone plays in creating what we call home, Concord Primary School.
