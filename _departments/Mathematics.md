The Math Department aims to equip our students with a strong foundation in Mathematics. Opportunities are created to allow our students to acquire important basic numeracy concepts and skills, develop logical reasoning and problem solving skills required in many disciplines in the students’ lives.

Aims of the Mathematics Department:

*   Develop students’ interest in Mathematics.
*   Develop students’ understanding of Math concepts.
*   Enable students to acquire Mathematical skills and then apply to real-life situations.
*   Enable students to think flexibly and use creative approaches to solve problems.
*   Enable students to use Mathematical language to communicate Mathematical ideas confidently and logically.
*   Develop students’ metacognitive skills to monitor own thinking and regulation of self-learning. 

Key Programmes:
---------------

_**Fostering Joy of Learning through Learning Experiences**_ 

Opportunities are created for our students to explore, experience and discover Mathematics through the daily lessons and Math programmes. The use of manipulative, ICT tools and Math conversation/ Math talks are ways to enhance the learning experiences in the Math lessons to instil joy of learning. Besides enhancing our students’ experiences so as to enable them to understand concepts, acquire Mathematical skills and be able to apply to real-life situations, activities are customised to allow our students to think flexibly and use creative approaches to solve problems

<u>Use of manipulative in the lessons (P1 to 6)</u>

<u>Use of ICT tools</u>   
ICT platforms such as Students Learning Space (SLS), Koobits and other ICT tools are used to provide a varied way to learning and assessment. Such platforms allow the students to acquire knowledge, do collaborative learning and allows assessment and revision to be done in a fun and interactive manner. All students in Concord Primary are given a Koobits account and they can access the portal to do their own learning and earn points through the challenges and assignments given by their teachers. Termly prizes are given to classes and individual prizes to students with the highest points at each level.
