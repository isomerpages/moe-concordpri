<h2>Vision:</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">To develop resilient and reflective problem-solvers who can
apply Mathematics confidently in everyday life.</p>
<h2>Mission:</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">To provide authentic and rigorous Mathematics learning
experiences that develop students’ ability to discover, reason
and communicate mathematics with confidence.</p>
<h2>Department’s highlights/framework:</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Maths Department aims to nurture confident learners with
a strong foundation in Mathematics. We design learning
experiences that build essential numeracy skills, logical
reasoning and problem-solving abilities that empower students
to thrive in school, navigate real-world challenges and embrace
future opportunities.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">Our Maths Eagle Mascot is a natural extension of our school
mascots- Connor and Caylee. Inspired by the same spirit of
strength, curiosity and excellence, our Maths Eagle represents
how Concordians approach Mathematics- with confidence,
resilience and a love for learning. It carries forward the same
core values while highlighting our five focus areas in
Mathematics: Maths is Fun, Maths in Daily Life, Maths Grows
With Me, Every Mind Can Maths, and Maths Connects Us.

</p><h2>Key Programmes</h2>
<br>
<b style="color:#0000FF">Fostering Joy of Learning through Learning Experiences</b>
<p style="text-align:justify">Opportunities are created for our students to explore,
experience and discover Mathematics through daily lessons
and school-wide Maths programmes. The use of
manipulatives, ICT tools, and Maths Talks enhances students’
learning experiences and helps to instill the joy of learning.
Beyond supporting students in understanding concepts and
acquiring Mathematical skills, the learning experiences are
designed to help them apply mathematics to real-life situations,
think flexibly and use creative approaches to solve problems.
These experiences are aligned to our five key aspects of
Mathematics learning:
</p><li>Maths Grows With Me: Students develop confidence
and resilience as they learn, practise and strengthen
their mathematical thinking.
</li><li>Maths in Daily Life: Activities to help students see how
mathematics is used around them, making learning
relevant and meaningful.
</li><li>Every Mind Can Maths: Learning experiences are
designed to support and stretch students of all abilities,
reinforcing the belief that every child can learn and
succeed in mathematics
</li><li>Maths Connects Us: Collaborative tasks and Math
Talks that help students communicate, reason and
learn with their peers, strengthening connection and
teamwork.
</li><li>Maths is Fun: Engaging games, hands-on activities
and playful challenges that build enjoyment and
positive attitudes towards mathematics.
	
<br>Overall, our approach ensures that every child experiences
mathematics as a subject that is meaningful, connected and
joyful.

<u><b>Use of manipulative in the lessons (P1 to 6)
</b></u>
<br>In our lessons, students from Primary 1 to 6 use manipulatives
such as counters, cubes and fraction disc. To grasp a good
understanding of ideas before moving on to diagrams and
numbers.
We use the Concrete–Pictorial–Abstract (C.P.A.) approach:
	
</li><li>Concrete: Students start by using real objects they can
touch and move.
</li><li>Pictorial: They then draw or use diagrams (e.g., bar
models, number bonds) to show their thinkin
</li><li>Abstract: Finally, they use numbers, operations and
symbols to solve problems.
	
<br>This approach helps students understand concepts more
clearly, build confidence and reduce misconceptions, laying a
strong foundation for learning Mathematics.

	<u><b>Math Playground (P1 and P2)</b></u>
<p style="text-align:justify">Math Playground in Concord allows our students to have fun
doing Mathematical activities. Apart from the hands-on
activities, the corner provides a platform for them to solve nonroutine
problems through puzzles and games. The corner is
open for Primary 1 to 2 students during their recess breaks and
students get an opportunity to participate in challenging games
such as Sudoku, Chess and Math Puzzles during their
recesses. Students may also practise mastering their number
facts through the online games accessible via tablets at the
corner.</p> 	

<u><b>Maths Playground </b></u>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Maths Playground is a dedicated space in school where
students can experience the joy of mathematics through
hands-on games, puzzles and collaborative play. Students
explore and enjoy Mathematics learning through purposeful
play that strengthens:
	
</p></li><li>Logical thinking
</li><li>Spatial awareness
</li><li>Reasoning and problem-solving
</li><li>Communication and teamwork
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">Through games such as Jenga, Save the Penguin, Connect
Four logic puzzles and number challenges, students learn to
think flexibly, try different strategies, be resilient and support
one another- skills that are essential in mathematics.
<br>The Maths Playground also reinforces our school values,
where students learn to:
	
</p></li><li>Respect the equipment and one another
</li><li>Take responsibility for keeping the area neat and safe
</li><li>Care for their peers by playing fairly and encouraging
one another<br>
	
<p style="text-align:justify">Overall , the Maths Playground makes mathematics come alive
for students and helps students build positive attitudes towards
mathematics, turning learning into an experience that is fun and
meaningful.

<b style="color:#0000FF; font-size:18px">Developing Metacognition and Problem-Solving skills (Primary 1 to 6)</b>
	
	
</p><p style="text-align:justify">S.T.A.R. approach was adopted from George Polya’s four-step process for problem solving. It was created to help our students to scaffold their thinking when they tackle heuristics and problem sums via the questions at each step of the approach. When students solve problems, they will make use of the 4 steps -&nbsp;<u><b>S</b></u>tudy,&nbsp;<u><b>T</b></u>hink,&nbsp;<u><b>A</b></u>ct,&nbsp;<u><b>R</b></u>eview.&nbsp;Throughout these four steps, metacognition plays an essential role in problem-solving as students make and regulate their thinking and their decisions.  
The S.T.A.R. approach was customised into two versions. One for the Primary 1 and 2 students and the other for Primary 3 to 6 students.</p>

<b style="color:#0000FF; font-size:18px">Developing students' interest and talent in Mathematics</b>
<br><br>
<u><b>E2K Mathematics Programme (P4 and 5)</b></u>    
<p style="text-align:justify">This programme was developed by Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE).&nbsp; It was conceptualized as a Mathematics enrichment programme for upper primary students who demonstrate strong interest and ability in Mathematics.  
The programme aims to foster independence in mathematical thinking skills, as well as nurture other important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness and to enhance critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
<br>
<u><b>Maths Olympiad Enrichment Programme (Primary 4 and 5)</b></u>  
<p style="text-align:justify">The objectives of the programme&nbsp;are to enrich and stretch our students’ learning in Mathematics. Through this programme, students have the opportunities to deepen their thinking and be equipped with strategies to solve non-routine and higher order challenges.</p>  
<br> 
<u><b>Maths Competitions (Primary 4 to 6)</b></u>  
<p style="text-align:justify">The objectives of participating in Math competitions are to expose our students to intellectually challenging mathematical questions, to challenge and stretch their mathematical potential, to stimulate their interest and ignite their passion in Mathematics.&nbsp;Our students have been exposed to the following competitions:
