<h2>Vision:</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">To develop resilient and reflective problem-solvers who can
apply Mathematics confidently in everyday life.</p>
<h2>Mission:</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">To provide authentic and rigorous Mathematics learning
experiences that develop students’ ability to discover, reason
and communicate mathematics with confidence.</p>
<h2>Department’s highlights/framework:</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Maths Department aims to nurture confident learners with
a strong foundation in Mathematics. We design learning
experiences that build essential numeracy skills, logical
reasoning and problem-solving abilities that empower students
to thrive in school, navigate real-world challenges and embrace
future opportunities.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">Our Maths Eagle Mascot is a natural extension of our school
mascots- Connor and Caylee. Inspired by the same spirit of
strength, curiosity and excellence, our Maths Eagle represents
how Concordians approach Mathematics- with confidence,
resilience and a love for learning. It carries forward the same
core values while highlighting our five focus areas in
Mathematics: Maths is Fun, Maths in Daily Life, Maths Grows
With Me, Every Mind Can Maths, and Maths Connects Us.

</p><h2>Key Programmes</h2>
<br>
<b style="color:#0000FF">Fostering Joy of Learning through Learning Experiences</b>
<p style="text-align:justify">Opportunities are created for our students to explore,
experience and discover Mathematics through daily lessons
and school-wide Maths programmes. The use of
manipulatives, ICT tools, and Maths Talks enhances students’
learning experiences and helps to instill the joy of learning.
Beyond supporting students in understanding concepts and
acquiring Mathematical skills, the learning experiences are
designed to help them apply mathematics to real-life situations,
think flexibly and use creative approaches to solve problems.
These experiences are aligned to our five key aspects of
Mathematics learning:
</p><li>Maths Grows With Me: Students develop confidence
and resilience as they learn, practise and strengthen
their mathematical thinking.
</li><li>Maths in Daily Life: Activities to help students see how
mathematics is used around them, making learning
relevant and meaningful.
</li><li>Every Mind Can Maths: Learning experiences are
designed to support and stretch students of all abilities,
reinforcing the belief that every child can learn and
succeed in mathematics
</li><li>Maths Connects Us: Collaborative tasks and Math
Talks that help students communicate, reason and
learn with their peers, strengthening connection and
teamwork.
</li><li>Maths is Fun: Engaging games, hands-on activities
and playful challenges that build enjoyment and
positive attitudes towards mathematics.
	
<br>Overall, our approach ensures that every child experiences
mathematics as a subject that is meaningful, connected and
joyful.

<u><b>Use of EdTech tools</b></u>   
<p style="text-align:justify">ICT platforms such as Students Learning Space (SLS), Koobits and other ICT tools are used to provide a varied way to learning and assessment. Such platforms allow the students to acquire knowledge, do collaborative learning and allows assessment and revision to be done in a fun and interactive manner. All students in Concord Primary are given a Koobits account and they can access the portal to do their own learning and earn points through the challenges and assignments given by their teachers. Termly prizes are given to classes and individual prizes to students with the highest points at each level.</p>

<u><b>Math Playground (P1 and P2)</b></u> 
<p style="text-align:justify">Math Playground in Concord allows our students to have fun doing Mathematical activities. Apart from the hands-on activities, the corner provides a platform for them to solve non-routine problems through puzzles and games. The corner is opened for Primary 1 to 2 students during their recesses and students get an opportunity to participate in challenging games such as Sudoku, Chess and Math Puzzles during their recesses. Students may also practice on mastering their number facts through the online games accessible via tablets at the corner.</p>

<b style="color:#0000FF; font-size:18px">Developing Metacognition and Problem-Solving skills (Primary 1 to 6)</b>
<p style="text-align:justify">S.T.A.R. approach was adopted from George Polya’s four-step process for problem solving. It was created to help our students to scaffold their thinking when they tackle heuristics and problem sums via the questions at each step of the approach. When students solve problems, they will make use of the 4 steps -&nbsp;<u><b>S</b></u>top,&nbsp;<u><b>T</b></u>hink,&nbsp;<u><b>A</b></u>ct,&nbsp;<u><b>R</b></u>eflect.&nbsp;Throughout these four steps, metacognition plays an essential role in problem-solving as students make and regulate their thinking and their decisions.  
The S.T.A.R. approach was customised into two versions. One for the Primary 1 and 2 students and the other for Primary 3 to 6 students.</p>

<br><br>
<u><b>E2K Mathematics Programme (P4 and 5)</b></u>    
<p style="text-align:justify">This programme was developed by Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE).&nbsp; It was conceptualized as a Mathematics enrichment programme for upper primary students who demonstrate strong interest and ability in Mathematics.  
The programme aims to foster independence in mathematical thinking skills, as well as nurture other important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness and to enhance critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
<br>
<u><b>Math Olympiad Enrichment Programme (Primary 4 and 5)</b></u>  
<p style="text-align:justify">The objectives of the programme&nbsp;are to enrich and stretch our students’ learning in Mathematics. Through this programme, students have the opportunities to deepen their thinking and be equipped with strategies to solve non-routine and higher order challenges.</p>  
<br> 
<u><b>Math Competitions (Primary 4 to 6)</b></u>  
<p style="text-align:justify">The objectives of participating in Math competitions are to expose our students to intellectually challenging mathematical questions, to challenge and stretch their mathematical potential, to stimulate their interest and ignite their passion in Mathematics.&nbsp;Our students have been exposed to the following competitions:
