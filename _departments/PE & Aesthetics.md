Mission
-------

Providing a safe, positive and vibrant environment and a broad and rich curriculum where all Concordians can be encouraged to succeed in becoming fit and healthy individuals.

Vision
------

Every Concordian should have the opportunity to take part in the physical activities on a regular basis and become physically confident and competent. Through all the sporting and physical activities, Concordians will potentially develop a love and passion for sports and continue this into their later lives.

  

Our PE curriculum aims to ensure that all Concordians develop their fundamental skills and competence to excel in a wide range of physical activities from Primary 1 to 6. This is to provide them with a broad and balanced curriculum with opportunities for all to enjoy.

  

We provide our students with 2 to 2½ hours of active PE lessons weekly and purposeful play to keep them healthy and at the same time, educating them on a healthy, balanced diet and lifestyle. Also, through our daily PE lessons, we aim to promote teamwork, sportsmanship, fairplay and healthy eating. Through our daily cooperative and competitive games, they will develop communication and collaboration. They will understand the importance of resilience, perseverance and respect amongst peers.

----------

Concord Primary School is committed to… 

*   Provide a safe, secure and vibrant environment where all Concordians can enjoy and play
*   Adopt a challenging, broad and exciting PE curriculum which will actively encourage, motivate and develop every Concordian to feel healthy and happy
*   Promote active and mass participation so that every Concordian will have the ‘can-do’ spirit

The Primary 4 and 6 students will have to go through compulsory NAPFA (ie. National Physical Fitness Assessment) tests according to the National standards starting from the month of April to August in school. It involves a series of five stations and a 1.6km Walk-Run.

The PE department also organises specialised games and sports for students from Primary 3 to 6 – games like Tchoukball, Kinball, Roller-blading, Archery, etc. These introductory sports are usually carried out by specialised vendors and our PE teachers would supervise our students during the Modular Programme sessions. Such experiential learning will bring about rich exposure and thus, making learning more enjoyable and fun for both our students and teachers.

Finally, the Primary 5 students will get to enjoy the Residential Adventure Camp. It will run for 3 days and 2 nights. Over the 3 days, our students will experience the low elements course and other outdoor activities such as trekking, navigating and outdoor cooking.

The Department also seeks to promote the mastery of skills and creativity in the Aesthetics domain through an enriching and wholesome Art and Music curriculum. Our students are introduced to a variety of Art forms based on different genre and ethnic cultures. Key programmes such as Artist in the Spotlight and Wall of Expressions help students to develop propensity for Arts appreciation and forms of expression.

  

Other than learning about the fundamental theory of music, our students are exposed to a variety of musical instruments during their modular music lessons, such as Recorders, Orff, Cajon, Ukulele and Guitar. They are given opportunity to exhibit their skills through performances at school assembly programmes and important school events. The students also undergo music appreciation experiences outside of their classroom through attending musicals and concerts.
