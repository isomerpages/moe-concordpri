Mission
-------

Providing a safe, positive and vibrant environment and a broad and rich curriculum where all Concordians can be encouraged to succeed in becoming fit and healthy individuals.

Vision
------

Every Concordian should have the opportunity to take part in the physical activities on a regular basis and become physically confident and competent. Through all the sporting and physical activities, Concordians will potentially develop a love and passion for sports and continue this into their later lives.

  

Our PE curriculum aims to ensure that all Concordians develop their fundamental skills and competence to excel in a wide range of physical activities from Primary 1 to 6. This is to provide them with a broad and balanced curriculum with opportunities for all to enjoy.

  

We provide our students with 2 to 2½ hours of active PE lessons weekly and purposeful play to keep them healthy and at the same time, educating them on a healthy, balanced diet and lifestyle. Also, through our daily PE lessons, we aim to promote teamwork, sportsmanship, fairplay and healthy eating. Through our daily cooperative and competitive games, they will develop communication and collaboration. They will understand the importance of resilience, perseverance and respect amongst peers.

Objectives
----------

Concord Primary School is committed to… 

*   Provide a safe, secure and vibrant environment where all Concordians can enjoy and play
*   Adopt a challenging, broad and exciting PE curriculum which will actively encourage, motivate and develop every Concordian to feel healthy and happy
*   Promote active and mass participation so that every Concordian will have the ‘can-do’ spirit

The Primary 4 and 6 students will have to go through compulsory NAPFA (ie. National Physical Fitness Assessment) tests according to the National standards starting from the month of April to August in school. It involves a series of five stations and a 1.6km Walk-Run.

Such experiential learning will bring about rich exposure and thus, making learning more enjoyable and fun for both our students and teachers.

S.P.I.N

**S.P.I.N.** is one of the key department initiatives and it stands for **S**top **P**hysical **I**nactivity **N**ow. It is a programme designed for overweight P3-P6 students to empower them to lose weight through increased physical activity and healthy eating. In the first SPIN session, SPINNERS will be given information on tips and suggestions on how they can lose weight.

  

SPINNERS meet twice a week to exercise. They meet during recess time for about 15 minutes for a customised sports and games. The SPINNERS also measure their height and weight at the end of each month to monitor their weight gain/loss. The SPINNERS are also taught to monitor their food intake and the type of food they consume by keeping a record of their diet daily. Through these measures, the SPINNERS are armed with skills to take control of their health and are encouraged to take positive steps towards combating obesity.

Sports Carnival and Lower Primary Games
---------------------------------------

The annual Sports Carnival and Lower Primary Games day are key events which receive much anticipation and garners excitement from the students. The main objective of these events is to promote mass participation among students in sports and games. Through this event, the students are given opportunity to apply the various motor skills which they have acquired during their PE lessons. Other than promoting mass participation in sports, these events also promote a strong sense of camaraderie among students from the same class and sportsmanship in the games. The students are also given the platform to exhibit the core values of respect and resilience during the games.

Aesthetics

The Department also seeks to promote the mastery of skills and creativity in the Aesthetics domain through an enriching and wholesome Art and Music curriculum. Our students are introduced to a variety of Art forms based on different genre and ethnic cultures. Key programmes such as Artist in the Spotlight and Wall of Expressions help students to develop propensity for Arts appreciation and forms of expression.

  

Other than learning about the fundamental theory of music, our students are exposed to a variety of musical instruments during their modular music lessons, such as Recorders, Orff, Cajon, Ukulele and Guitar. They are given opportunity to exhibit their skills through performances at school assembly programmes and important school events. The students also undergo music appreciation experiences outside of their classroom through attending musicals and concerts.
