<h3>Education Technology Department </h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">The EdTech Department leads the school in designing meaningful, 
inclusive and student-directed digital learning experiences. We support teachers and student
in using technology effectively for teaching, learning,collaboration and innovation. The Edtech
department strives to harness technology to transform teaching and learning landscape;strengthening the development of students' digital literacy by Enabling, Exploring and Enriching teaching and learning
through the use of technology.

<h3>Digi(IT)ai@Concord</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Digital literacy (DL) is defined as a set of knowledge, skills and dispositions
that would help our Concordians to be confident, critical and resposible users of digital technologies for information, communication and problem solving. 
	
</p><p style="text-align:justify">Aligned to the The Find, Think, Apply, Create(FTAC) framework, students will acquire digital skills across four components in the FTAC framework.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The FTAC framework is unpacked into nine Digital Competencies (DCs)to support deepening of digital literacy in schools. The development of the Digital Competencies will equip students with the abilities to Find, Think, Apply and Create effectively in digitalised environment. </p>


<h3>Integrating EdTech into Teaching and Learning</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">In Concord, we leveraged the use of technology to create engaging and meaningful learning experiences. Digital tools are thoughtfully integrated into our E3 Reasoning+ Programme. Through this- integration, students develop essential baseline ICT skills, digital literacy and technological skills - while thinking critically, collaborating effectively, and taking ownership of their learning.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">To further strengthen their digital literacy and technology skills, students also engage in self-directed learning via the Student Learning Space (SLS). These SLS modules are mapped to the nine Digital Competencies across all levels and support the attainment of specific learning outcomes aligned with the FTAC framework.</p>


<h3>EdTech Beyond the Classroom</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify"></p>As part or our post-PSLE-activity, Primary 6 students participate in the Code for Fun Programme, in ,collaboration with the Infocomm Media Development Authority(IMDA).
This programme introduces students to block-based programming through interactive, hands-on activities. Through the programme, students:

<li>Learn about core computational thinking concepts and how it can be applied to daily life
</li><li>Understand basic programming concepts such as debugging, events, loops, variables, functions,  and conditionals.
</li><li>Develop logical thinking and problem-solving.
