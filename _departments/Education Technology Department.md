<h3>Digi(IT)ai@Concord</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Digital literacy (DL) is defined as a set of knowledge, skills and dispositions
that would help our Concordians to be confident, critical and resposible users of digital technologies for information, communication and problem solving. 
	
</p><p style="text-align:justify">Aligned to the The Find, Think, Apply, Create(FTAC) framework, students will acquire digital skills across four components in the FTAC framework.

<p style="text-align:justify">The FTAC framework is unpacked into nine Digital Competencies (DCs)to support deepening of digital literacy in schools. The development of the Digital Competencies will equip students with the abilities to Find, Think, Apply and Create effectively in digitalised environment. </p>











<h3>Student Learning Space (SLS)</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">As one of the primary school piloting the Student Learning Space since 2017, teachers are exploring a wide range of ICT-facilitated strategies to engage our students in a student-centric learning environment. Tapping on the affordances of SLS and other ICT tools, students’ learning experiences are centered on the belief that quality learning is in the hands of the learners when we empower them with appropriate technology. With a shift of our focus to deepening the process of learning, development of 21st-century competencies such as communication, collaboration, and information skills takes shape when our students learn with technology.</p>
	
<h3>Learning Beyond Four Walls</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Under Concord’s Total Curriculum Framework, technology is designed into our Learning for Life Programme, Outdoor Education (OE). Outdoor Trails, I AM CONCORD!, are designed as opportunities for students to discover the heritage of Concord with their peers. Social-emotional learning is enriched as students work with their peers to navigate the tasks in the trail. The use of various iPad apps and QR Codes heighten our students' interests and spur their appetite for self-directed learning as they go about making connections with the ready information around them. Similar authentic ICT-enriched learning trails are also customised for Learning Journey to places such as Singapore Philatelic Museum and Little India.</p>
