Please help your child’s Form Teacher to have a better understanding of your child by providing additional information about your child via this [link](https://go.gov.sg/cps-pupilprofile).

**3.**     **Apply for GIRO**

GIRO is a convenient, paperless, and cashless payment method to make hassle-free payments for your child’s school fees and standard miscellaneous fees.

Parents/guardians will be able to apply for GIRO online for payment of school fees and charges from **5 Dec 2022**.  The link will be available through Parents Gateway (PG) app. Parents will have up till 15 January 2023 to sign up for GIRO for the first deduction in Feb 2023.

**4.**     **Apply for** **EDUSAVE Account Standing Order** **_(For Singapore Citizens only)_**

The Edusave account is automatically opened by MOE for all Singaporean children studying at primary or secondary level in MOE-funded schools to receive annual Edusave contributions from the Government. Parents do not need to match the contributions.

The Edusave funds can be used for:

• 2nd-tier miscellaneous fees; and

• Level–wide enrichment programmes organised by the school

  

We strongly encourage you to sign up to reduce the out-of-pocket educational expenses for your child/ward. Schools will continue to inform and seek your consent for your child’s/ward’s participation before the withdrawal of Edusave funds. If you subsequently decide that you do not want to use your child’s/ward’s Edusave account to co-pay for enrichment programmes, you can terminate the standing order at any time.

Please sign up for the Standing Order [here](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5be24a1bb3f842000fdc4e59). Singpass login will be required.
