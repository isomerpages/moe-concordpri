<h3>Administrative Matters</h3>
<p>In preparation for your child’s entry to Primary One in 2026, please complete
the following items before the <strong>P1 Orientation Day</strong> on <strong>15 October 2025, Wednesday, 9 am - 10.30 am</strong>:</p>
<h4><strong><u>Section A: Mandatory Tasks</u></strong></h4>
<p>1.<strong> Onboard Parent Gateway</strong>
</p>
<p>Developed by the Ministry of Education and GovTech, Parents Gateway is
a one-stop portal that strengthens school-home partnership to support our
children in their education journey.</p>
<p>You may download Parent Gateway via this <a href="https://pg.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a> or Download “Parents Gateway” from
the official app stores (Google Play, App Store or Huawei AppGallery).</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.<strong> Apply for GIRO</strong>
</p>
<p>GIRO is a convenient, paperless, and cashless payment method to make hassle-free
payments for your child’s school fees and miscellaneous fees. The same
GIRO arrangement will also be extended to cover their payment of enrichment
programmes, school charges and deduction of Primary School Leaving Examination
Examinations fees.</p>
<p>The GIRO application can be made through the Parents Gateway (PG) app
under the Services tab. Parents will have up till 15 January 2026 to sign
up for GIRO for the first deduction in Feb 2026. Please refer to this
<a href="/files/egiro user guide sep23.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">guide</a>for more information.</p>
<p>Please note that each child requires a separate GIRO application, do ensure
you submit an individual application for each student.</p>

<p>
<br>3. <strong>Apply for Edusave Standing Order <em>(For Singapore Citizens only)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Every Singapore Citizen (SC) will have an Edusave account created automatically
for them.</p>
<p>For SCs in MOE-funded schools, they will receive annual contributions
from the start of their primary school education until they complete their
secondary school education.</p>
<p>Edusave funds can be used for:
<br>
<br>• Approved Fees by MOE (e.g. miscellaneous fees); and
<br>• Level–wide enrichment programmes organised by the school.</p>
<p>To enable the school to use your child’s Edusave account to pay for the
above expenses, you will need to sign up for the Edusave Standing Order
via the PG app. Schools will continue to inform and seek your consent for
your child’s/ward’s participation before the withdrawal of Edusave funds.
If you subsequently decide that to use alternative funding sources for
enrichment programmes, you can terminate the Standing Order at any time.</p>
<p>You can sign up for the Standing Order <a href="https://form.gov.sg/68511c58e85a5dd195cf326f" rel="noopener referrer" target="_blank">here</a>. Singpass
login will be required.
