<h3>Administrative Matters</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">In preparation for your child’s entry to Primary One in 2024, please complete the following items before the P1 Orientation Day on 18 October 2023, Wednesday:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:24px"><u><b>Section A: Mandatory Tasks</b></u></p><br>
<b>1.  Apply for GIRO</b>

<p style="text-align:justify">GIRO is a convenient, paperless, and cashless payment method to make hassle-free payments for your child’s school fees and miscellaneous fees. The same GIRO arrangement will also be extended to cover their payment of enrichment programmes, school charges and deduction of Primary School Leaving Examination Examinations fees.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The GIRO application can be made through the Parents Gateway (PG) app under the Services tab. Parents will have up till 15 January 2024 to sign up for GIRO for the first deduction in Feb 2024. Please refer to this <a href="/files/egiro%20user%20guide%20sep23.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">guide</a> for more information.</p><br>

<b>2.  Apply for Edusave Standing Order <em>(For Singapore Citizens only)</em></b>
<p style="text-align:justify">Every Singapore Citizen (SC) will have an Edusave account created automatically for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">For SCs in MOE-funded schools, they will receive annual contributions from the start of their primary school education until they complete their secondary school education.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Edusave funds can be used for:<br><br> •	Approved Fees by MOE (e.g. miscellaneous fees); and<br>•	Level–wide enrichment programmes organised by the school.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">To enable the school to use your child’s Edusave account to pay for the above expenses, you will need to sign up for the Edusave Standing Order via the PG app. Schools will continue to inform and seek your consent for your child’s/ward’s participation before the withdrawal of Edusave funds. If you subsequently decide that to use alternative funding sources for enrichment programmes, you can terminate the Standing Order at any time.</p>
