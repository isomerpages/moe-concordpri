<h3><strong>Join M.A.D parents</strong></h3>
<p>Our Parent Support Group is known as M.A.D@Concord. M.A.D. refers to "Make
A Difference," and we welcome all parents to join this community to partner
with the school in the development of our students. The EXCO members of
M.A.D@Concord liaise with school personnel to plan for school events and
improve collaborations through more coordinated support efforts.</p>
