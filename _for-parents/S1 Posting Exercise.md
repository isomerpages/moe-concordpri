Improved Online Resources for S1 Posting Exercise
-------------------------------------------------

  
The S1 IB is published annually to facilitate P6 students and parents in choosing secondary schools during the S1 Posting Exercise (held in Nov - Dec). Since last year, MOE has improved the support and resources available to P6 students and parents. For example, the [S1 Website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting) has been enhanced to provide useful information and designed for better user experience. The [SchoolFinder](https://go.gov.sg/schoolfinder) is also easy to use, with filters such as location, CCAs, subjects and PSLE score range, to help users shortlist secondary schools. Many students and parents have since switched to using these online resources.  
  

In addition to this, collaterals and materials are made available for students and parents to understand the PSLE scoring and S1 Posting process, e.g. via the LENS package. As part of lessons conducted during Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), students were guided through the various factors to consider when choosing a secondary school. Additional guides are provided via the S1 information sheet on how to find relevant information on secondary schools using the MOE [S1 Website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting) and [SchoolFinder](https://go.gov.sg/schoolfinder). In view of the many resources available and the whole-of-government effort to leverage digital technology to improve service standards and users’ experience, **the S1 IB will be discontinued from printing** from this year onwards.

  

<p style="text-align:justify">The school understands that P6 students and parents will generally research on secondary schools from Term 3 onwards. Therefore, please familiarise yourselves with the online resources (see below):

**MOE Website:** Contains essential and up-to-date information on S1 Posting process ([https://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting](https://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting))

<b>SchoolFinder:</b> Similar to school profile page in the S1 IB, users can search and shortlist schools easily based on a set of criteria (e.g. location, CCA, PSLE score ranges, etc). The school information are up-to-date and secondary schools will publish their latest school information for the next academic year by Term 4. School staff may refer to the attached guide and the online tutorial guide to learn/refresh themselves on how to use the SchoolFinder ([https://go.gov.sg/schoolfinder](https://go.gov.sg/schoolfinder)).

*   Other digital resources are provided by MOE HQ through primary schools (e.g. DSA-Sec Information Sheet, S1 Posting Information Sheet, LENS packages, Microlearning Unit); and
*   Publications and collaterals will continue to be made available as well (e.g. [Secondary School Education Booklet](https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/courses), ECG collaterals)
