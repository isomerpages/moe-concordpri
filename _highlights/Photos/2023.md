P1 and P6 Buddy Programme
-------------------------

  

<p style="text-align:justify">A new school with new experiences can be a daunting for our Primary 1 (P1) students. To help our P1 students acclimatize to their new environment, each student was paired with a Primary 6 (P6) &nbsp;buddy to help with this transition. From helping them to buy food in the school canteen, to gentle reminders and advice on how to take care of themselves, to discovering different parts of the school, the P6 buddies were their ever trustful and reliable guides.&nbsp;
