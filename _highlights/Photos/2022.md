Primary 5 Outdoor Adventure Camp 2022
-------------------------------------

The Annual Primary 5 Outdoor Adventure Camp is an integral part of the school’s holistic education programme. In alignment with Covid-19 safety management measures, the school organized a non-residential day camp for our P5 cohort, from 1 to 3 June 2022.

The theme of the camp was “Kampong Days @ Concord”. Students worked together in their teams, and as a cohort, fostering important life skills, such as teamwork, independence, resilience and relationship management through outdoor adventure learning activities.

It was also a great bonding session for both the P5 teachers and their students.&nbsp;

* Using what students have acquired in their previous years on orienteering, students applied the use of pacing, scaling and map legend to design a map.
* Throughout the 4 weeks, students were facilitated to reflect on their performance to gain an understanding about self-awareness, social awareness and relationship management.

Levels of students involved (if any):
* Primary 6 cohort

Link to the school mission / vision / motto / creed:  

•Vision: Map creation as a group harmoniously enriches the minds of students to apply knowledge&nbsp; &nbsp;and skills acquired for practical use in outdoor activities, as well as honing the determined spirit in&nbsp;them to complete an unfamiliar task.

•Motto: The application of mathematics during measurements and scaling ignites the passion of learning as students find relevance and real-world application of what they learn in school.

•Creed: Successive improvement of their maps would promote students’ confidence and belief in&nbsp; &nbsp;themselves that they were able to achieve more as a team, soaring to greater heights together.

  

### Scientist-in-School Programme 2021


We are honored to partner Dr Ashar, an A\* STAR scientist, since we implemented the above programme in November 2011. As part of our school’s Science &amp; Education Career Guidance programme, Dr Ashar shared his educational life journey as well as his career path as a Scientist with two Primary 5 classes. Besides being able to see him via zoom meetings, students got to clarify more on a Scientist’s role and work! Some even took the opportunity to ask him on Science topics beyond their syllabus! Those who were not able to ask questions within the one-hour session could actually continue to engage Dr Ashar through padlet.

 In addition, Dr Ashar helped review some of our existing Science outdoor trail lessons and offer his advice. He also designed and conducted an enrichment lesson on Electromagnets for 20 selected Primary 4, 5 and 6 students. This lesson covered contents beyond the Primary Science syllabus and consisted of hands-on activity using a mini resource kit.

The theme of this year’s Chinese New Year Celebration is Adaptive Resilience, Continued Prosperity. Students were introduced to the customs and traditions of Chinese New Year as well as the new norm of Chinese New Year Celebration in this period of pandemic times through the virtual skit put up by the staff and students. Concord’s school values of Responsibility and Resilience were reinforced through the various segment within the virtual celebration. Time was set aside for Form teachers and Co-form teachers to bond with their class through the class bonding activities planned by them for their students. The celebration ended on a high note with the Chinese New Year mascot, God of Fortune and 2 Tigers, making their appearances in the classrooms, sending well wishes to the Concordians, wishing them an abundance of joy, happiness and prosperity in the Year of the Tiger.&nbsp;
