Primary 5 Outdoor Adventure Camp 2022
-------------------------------------

The Annual Primary 5 Outdoor Adventure Camp is an integral part of the school’s holistic education programme. In alignment with Covid-19 safety management measures, the school organized a non-residential day camp for our P5 cohort, from 1 to 3 June 2022.

The theme of the camp was “Kampong Days @ Concord”. Students worked together in their teams, and as a cohort, fostering important life skills, such as teamwork, independence, resilience and relationship management through outdoor adventure learning activities.

It was also a great bonding session for both the P5 teachers and their students.
