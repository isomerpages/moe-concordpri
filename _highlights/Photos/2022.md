<h3>P6 Sports and Outdoor Adventure Camp</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">The P6 Sports and Outdoor Adventure camp was a 2.5 day non-residential camp in school from 18 to 20 October 2022. It has provided an excellent opportunity for students to experience the outdoors and learn many important life skills, such as teamwork, independence, fair play and relationship management. One of the main aim of the camp was to prepare students for secondary school, while instilling in them leadership qualities and the 6 school core values – resilience, care, responsibility, respect, integrity and loyalty.

<p style="text-align:justify">During the camp, students participated in many activities which enhanced their physical, mental and emotional resilience. Such activities included Archery Tag, Outdoor cooking, Hike at Wallace Trail, building a Trebuchet as their camp craft and other team building games too. They learned to work cooperatively as a team to achieve the objectives of these activities.

<p style="text-align:justify">At the end of each activity, students were given the time of reflection where group facilitators provide feedback to groups and/or individuals. The time of reflection provides students the platform to understand their strengths and weaknesses. With this understanding, they learn to be a better team players and in hope to mould them to be leaders of the future.<br><br>

<b><u>Hiking at Wallace Trail</u></b>

<p style="text-align:justify">Students spotted many wild animals and insects along their trek at the Wallace Trail. Students learnt more about Dairy Farm at the Wallace Education Centre, where they were also tasked to complete worksheets in their groups.<br><br>

<h4>Scientist-in-School Programme 2021</h4>


<p style="text-align:justify">We are honored to partner Dr Ashar, an A\* STAR scientist, since we implemented the above programme in November 2011. As part of our school’s Science &amp; Education Career Guidance programme, Dr Ashar shared his educational life journey as well as his career path as a Scientist with two Primary 5 classes. Besides being able to see him via zoom meetings, students got to clarify more on a Scientist’s role and work! Some even took the opportunity to ask him on Science topics beyond their syllabus! Those who were not able to ask questions within the one-hour session could actually continue to engage Dr Ashar through padlet.

 <p style="text-align:justify">In addition, Dr Ashar helped review some of our existing Science outdoor trail lessons and offer his advice. He also designed and conducted an enrichment lesson on Electromagnets for 20 selected Primary 4, 5 and 6 students. This lesson covered contents beyond the Primary Science syllabus and consisted of hands-on activity using a mini resource kit.
