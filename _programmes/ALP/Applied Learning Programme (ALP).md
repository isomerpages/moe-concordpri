<h2><strong>ALP - E3 Reasoning (Enable, Enrich, Empower) @ Concord</strong></h2>
<p>Our E3 Reasoning Programme was officially endorsed by MOE and awarded
ALP status in 2014. This initiative is one of Concord's strategic levers
to nurture students holistically.</p>
<p>To prepare and equip our students for the complex challenges ahead, Concord
places a premium on enabling them to analyze, solve problems, and make
good decisions in life.</p>

<h3><strong>E3 Reasoning Lessons (Primary 1 – 2)</strong></h3>
<p>For our Primary 1 and 2 students, their weekly double-period E3 Reasoning
lessons aim to enable, enrich, and empower them to acquire critical and
inventive thinking skills, which are essential 21st-century competencies.
A multitude of activities is designed to teach reasoning skills explicitly
through a learner-centered pedagogy, with a focus on experiential learning
in every lesson.</p>
<p>The goal of learner-centered pedagogy is to maximize learning potential
as part of the students' learning experience. Primary 1 and 2 students
are encouraged to perform their skills or demonstrate their knowledge through
a three-pronged approach: Authentic Learning, Learning Through Play, and
Perspective-Taking via teachable moments. While using content to build
a knowledge base, we also aim to equip students with lifelong learning
skills.</p>
<p>Through our customized I-ACE methodology, Concord’s teachers are guided
to turn complexities into meaningful experiences for our Primary 1 and
2 students. This approach helps to introduce, consolidate, and extend students’
learning during and beyond the classroom. Our ultimate goal is to nurture
Concordians who are equipped with the ability to think deeply, rationalize
effectively, and decide wisely.</p>

<h3><strong>E3 Reasoning+ <em>(E3 Reasoning &amp; IPW) </em></strong><br><strong>(Primary 3 – 6)</strong></h3>
<p>For our Primary 3 to Primary 6 students, the 9-day “E3 Reasoning+” programme
in Term 2 integrates our <strong><em>Applied Learning Programme</em></strong> (E3
Reasoning) with <strong><em>Interdisciplinary Project Work</em></strong> (IPW).
Under E3 Reasoning+, IPW serves as a platform for students to collaborate
and solve authentic tasks in an interdisciplinary setting. This programme
develops and enhances students’ E3 Reasoning skills while using the Design
Thinking process to guide their project work.</p>

<p>The “E3 Reasoning+” programme enables our students to work in teams and
apply their knowledge across subjects to address real life issues pertaining
to sustainable living such as water, food and energy sustainability and
contribute to a more sustainable future.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>To emphasize “project-based learning,” lesson packages and activity booklets
were created, and learning journeys were organized for students based on
specific level themes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>P3</strong>: Water Sustainability</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Primary 3 students learned about water sustainability efforts in Singapore,
gaining a deeper understanding of the importance of water conservation.
Through building water filters, they developed the ability to make connections
across different areas of knowledge and realized the need to make water
conservation a way of life.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>P4</strong>: Food Sustainability</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Primary 4 students explored Singapore’s challenges in food production
and its vulnerability in food supply. By creating innovative menus using
alternative food sources, they applied what they had learned and understood
that food security requires a collective effort, with everyone playing
a part.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>P5</strong>: Energy Sustainability</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Primary 5 students learned about energy sustainability and the importance
of embracing renewable energy in Singapore. By building innovative prototypes
of a green school, students were encouraged to think about how they can
help save energy and were motivated to take proactive steps toward sustainable
energy practices.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>P6</strong>: Sustainable Living</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Primary 6 students designed and built models of green buildings to showcase
their knowledge and understanding of sustainable living. They also shared
ideas for futuristic green buildings with their classmates during class
presentations.</p>

<p>The highlight of the programme is the group presentation, where students
consolidate their learning and apply the skills they have acquired. Through
this programme, our Primary 3 to 6 students have the opportunity to apply
their knowledge and skills across disciplines, see interconnections, hone
their inquisitiveness and imagination, and enhance their 21st-century competencies
in collaboration, communication, and critical and inventive thinking.</p>

<p>Most importantly, the programme helps students acquire skills for independent
learning—reflecting on their learning and taking appropriate actions to
improve it.</p>
