<h4>E3 Reasoning (Enable, Enrich, Empower) @ Concord</h4>
<p>As Concord aspires towards greater heights, various initiatives to make
our student’s learning more diverse and inclusive, while maintaining high
quality and meritocracy, have helped ensure its curriculum to be forward
looking to prepare our students for the future. Our E3 Reasoning Programme
has been officially endorsed by MOE and awarded the ALP status in 2014.
This is one of the strategic levers of Concord to nurture our students
holistically.</p>
<p>To prepare and equip our students for the complex challenges ahead, Concord
places a premium on enabling our students to be able to analyse, solve
problems and make good decisions in life.</p>
<p><strong>Our E3 Reasoning Programme (ALP)</strong> is aimed to enable, enrich
and empower our students to acquire critical and inventive thinking skills
which are essential 21st Century skills. A multitude of activities are
designed to teach our students reasoning skills explicitly through our
learner-centred pedagogy where experiential learning is focused for every
lesson.</p>
<p>The goal of learner-centred pedagogy is to maximise learning potential
as part of their learning experience where students perform their skills
or demonstrate their knowledge through the 3-pronged approach :<strong> Authentic Learning, Learning</strong> through
play and <strong>Perspective Taking</strong> through teachable moments. Our
teachers use the content to develop a knowledge base – but we also want
to help our students to develop learning skills that they need across a
lifetime of learning.</p>
<p>Through our<strong> customised I-ACE</strong> methodology, Concord’s teachers
are guided to turn complexities into meaningful experiences for our students.
This approach helps to introduce, consolidate and extend student’s learning
during and beyond the classroom. We hope to nurture Concordians who are
equipped with the abilities to think deeply, rationalize effectively and
decide wisely. Indeed, it is through <strong>E3 Reasoning@ Concord</strong> where
your child’s reasoning becomes visible.</p>
<p>We have continued our endeavours to stretch our students who have shown
interest and aptitude in E3 Reasoning through <strong>Lego Robotics</strong> and <strong>Code For fun Enrichment Programmes</strong> for
our Primary 3 to 5 students who have shown greater interest and aptitude
in E3 Reasoning. Our Primary 1 to 2 students will also get a chance to
experience reasoning through <strong>Magic!</strong>
</p>
<p>In anticipating complex challenges ahead where content knowledge may be
rendered obsolete, Concord will continue to prepare our students by equipping
them with competencies and skills that would provide them with a good foundation
beyond their primary school years.</p>

<p>Tier 1 caters to all students which includes the infusion of E3 Reasoning
skills in all subjects and various programme catered to the different levels.
<br>
<br><strong><u>P1 and 2 E3 Reasoning lessons and assembly programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>2 periods (1 hour) per week is scheduled during curriculum time to introduce
and teach our Primary 1 and 2 students E3 Reasoning skills. Learner-centred
pedagogy, focussing on experiential learning through activities such as
games and role-play, is used to engage students during these lessons.</p>
<p>Assembly programme for the Primary 1 and 2 students are specially crafted
to enable the students more opportunities to learn about the application
of E3 Reasoning skills in their daily lives.
<br>
<br><strong><u>Learn to Play, Play to Learn Corner (LPPL Corner)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The corner is opened from Tuesdays to Thursdays during recess time to
allow students to play E3 Reasoning games. The games allow students to
develop and practise their E3 Reasoning skills.
<br>
<br><strong><u>Modular CCA Programme (Soar for Life)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>E3 Reasoning has been integrated as part of the Modular CCA programme
for our Primary 3 to 6 students. During the programme, our students get
to learn and apply E3 Reasoning skills through the various activities.
The table below shows the activities carried out for each level during
Soar for Life.
<br>
<br><strong><u>Lego Robotics</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Lego Robotics is our Tier 2 programme to stretch our students with greater
interest and aptitude in E3 Reasoning skills to further strengthen and
hone their skills. The objectives are to enable students to think creatively,
analyse situations and apply critical thinking and problem solving skills
to real world problems. It also provides opportunities to develop collaboration
skills among students when they get to work together to solve problems
in groups and to develop 21st CC.</p>
