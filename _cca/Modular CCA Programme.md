<p style="text-align:justify">As part of the two tier approach for our Concord CCA framework, the Modular CCA (MCCA) Programme reaches the masses. It offers every P3 to P6 student the opportunity to develop skills and knowledge from a wide variety of experiences, such as Outdoor Education, Sports, Aesthetics and other critical skills such as ICT and Lifeskills. In 2022, we have adopted an integrated approach to address our students’ development of leadership, E3 Reasoning and executive functioning skills in a coherent and holistic way through a new module – Soar For Life.&nbsp;We envision that, through MCCA, our students will become all-rounders who has a passion for learning and develop the confidence to face the challenges of life.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Primary 3 to P6 classes will be having Modular CCA according to the schedule below. To provide an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development of leadership, E3 Reasoning and executive functioning skills in a coherent and holistic way, a new module – Soar For Life, has been designed for this purpose.</p> 

<p style="text-align:justify">P3 students will be involved in the Sports Talent Identification Programme. Students will be exposed to Niche Sports CCAs such as Sepak Takraw, Volleyball, Floorball and Badminton. Students who exhibit talent in these CCAs will receive additional training during the Niche CCA sessions conducted after school.</p>
