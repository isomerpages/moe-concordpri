<p style="text-align:justify">Indian dance is a vibrant Performing Arts CCA. The dancers are exposed to an array of dance where growth and learning is encouraged. The dancers not only hone their dance skills but develop a sense of self-confidence and cultural identity.

</p><p style="text-align:justify">Our dancers learn a mix of folk, traditional and contemporary dances. We believe that a mix of these dances are required for learning and sharpening their dance skills. Our dancers are given many opportunities to showcase their dancing skills in and out of school. Students realize their potential through these opportunities and master new skills which in turn helps to increase their self-esteem.
