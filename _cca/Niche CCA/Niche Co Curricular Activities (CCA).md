<h3>Talent Development Programme</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The 2nd tier, Niche CCA, focuses on Talent Management. Through a systematic
identification process, selected students are offered one of the seven
CCAs either in the Sports or the Aesthetics domains. These selected students,
trained and developed by hired instructors and coaches during outside curriculum
time, represent the school in National competitions and perform during
school events as well as in events organized by external agencies.</p>
