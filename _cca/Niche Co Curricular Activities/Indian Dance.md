Indian dance is a vibrant Performing Arts CCA. The dancers are exposed to an array of dance where growth and learning is encouraged. The dancers not only hone their dance skills but develop a sense of self-confidence and cultural identity.

Our dancers learn a mix of folk, traditional and contemporary dances. We believe that a mix of these dances are required for learning and sharpening their dance skills. Our dancers are given many opportunities to showcase their dancing skills in and out of school. Students realize their potential through these opportunities and master new skills which in turn helps to increase their self-esteem.

<u><strong>Achievements:</strong></u>

For the past few years, we have been performing at school, external venues and also taking part in the SYF Central Judging.Our dance group has achieved Certificate of Distinction in 2016 and 2018.

As part of the National Day 2017 celebration at The Treasury building, we were invited by the Ministry of Finance to perform a fusion dance, together with the International Dance members. It was indeed a proud moment for the dancers as they performed in front of for 4 Ministers. The dance was well received by the public.
