<p style="text-align:justify">Badminton has been introduced as one of the Sports CCAs since 2014.

<p style="text-align:justify">Boys for the CCA were selected after the P3 Selection Trials. P4, P5 and P6 boys who show keen interest were also recruited into the sport. A qualified coach trains the boys twice weekly from 3.30 pm to 5.30 pm. During the training sessions, the badminton players are taught different badminton skills and strategies to improve their game. In addition, sportsmanship, teamwork and resilience are emphasised every week during the training.
