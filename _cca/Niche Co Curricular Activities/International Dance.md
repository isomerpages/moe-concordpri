<p style="text-align:justify">International Dance is a vibrant Performing Arts CCA that aims to instil appreciation and greater interest for dance amongst our students. Our members are taught an array of dance genres, an avenue to deepen their dance skills as well as knowledge of different cultures. Our dance group is given many opportunities to showcase their dancing skills in and out of school. Students realize their potential through these opportunities and master new skills which in turn helps to increase their self-esteem.

<p style="text-align:justify">For the past few years, we have been performing at a few external venues and also taking part in the SYF Central Judging.

<p style="text-align:justify">Our dance group was invited to perform at “The Pillow Police Pyjama Party!” which is held in conjunction with World Sleep Day organized by Nanyang Technological University. Our students danced to Kpop songs and brought the house down with their stunning performance.

<p style="text-align:justify">We also took part in SYF Central Judging with our committed members. We achieved Certificate of Accomplishment for the SYF Central Judging in 2016 and 2018.

<p style="text-align:justify">Collaborating with our CCE department, we performed in Keat Hong CCC for the breakfast session at the Give and Take Corner. Mr Zaqy Mohamad, MP for Chua Chu Kang GRC (Keat Hong) was the guest of honour for this event.

<p style="text-align:justify">As part of the National Day celebration at The Treasury building, we were invited by the Ministry of Finance to perform a fusion dance, together with the Indian Dance members. It was a rather unique dance performance that awed everyone who watched it.
